                Sunlight fills the room with warmth, catching dust motes that dance like tiny faeries. The pink walls glow softly. On the bed, the stuffed animals are arranged in their usual pile, though you could swear the Eevee was facing the other way yesterday.

            <div class="room-desc">
                Stepping in from the main room you are confronted by a plush carpet underfoot, bright pink in colour. Scattered across the floor are cushions and pillows of all colours, some gathered into a small <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="nest">nest</span> against the southern wall. From the wall above the nest hangs a set of <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="nest">chains</span>, long enough for someone to curl up comfortably in the nest and ending in padded shackles, and a collar inscribed with "<span class="special">Auria</span>".
                <br><br>
                A comfy <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="bed">bed</span> stands opposite the door, made up neatly with a pale purple bedspread. Perched in the center of the bed is a fluffy <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="eevee">Eevee</span> plushie, with a jumbled pile around her; a plush dragon in shades of purple, a Squirtle and Chikorita small enough to fit in a coat pocket and a happy look raccoon.
                <br><br>
                Standing beside the nest of pillows is a large <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="bookcase">bookcase</span> packed with books, a few of the titles standing out; "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", "The Painted Man", "The Black Prism", "The Way of Kings". Beside the bookcase is pinned a note; "<span class="highlight">Feel free to add something! Just let me know which is yours!</span>"
                <br><br>
                Against the northern wall rests a <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="trunk">closed trunk</span>, and a small <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="wardrobe">wardrobe</span> stands against the southern wall. On a small table by the bed, a leather-bound <span class="highlight object-name" data-obj="journal">journal</span> lies open, pen beside it.

                A plush Eevee sits among the other stuffed animals, brown fur soft and well-loved. Glass eyes catch the light. It's clearly been hugged many times—the fur is worn in places, one ear slightly bent. Auria's favorite.

            <p>A small wardrobe stands against the southern wall. Peeking inside you can see colorful fabrics—dresses, soft things. Nothing practical. Everything pretty.</p>
